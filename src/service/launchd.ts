   * Bootstrap the job, waiting out the tail of our own `bootout` (§23.26).
   *
   * `launchctl bootout` returns before launchd has finished tearing the job down, and
   * anything landing in that window fails. Measured on the Mac Studio, booting out a
   * *running* job and bootstrapping immediately:
   *
   * ```
   * bootout   rc=0
   * bootstrap → "Bootstrap failed: 5: Input/output error"   (EIO, not EALREADY)
   * kickstart rc=37                                          (EALREADY)
   * 3 s later → not loaded
   * ```
   *
   * So the errno differs by verb, and keying the retry on one of them (§23.26 keyed it on 37)
   * misses the other. Retry on **any** failure instead: a bootstrap that fails is worth
   * re-attempting whatever it says, because the cost of being wrong is a machine with no
   * LaunchAgent at all. `install` verifies the job is really loaded afterwards, so a genuine
   * failure is reported rather than swallowed.
   *
   * Note that `launchctl print` keeps succeeding throughout this window — the dying job is
   * still listed — so "is it loaded?" cannot be used to detect the race, only to confirm the
   * end state once the retries are done.

  /**
   * Problems that leave a *loaded, running* job unable to look after itself (§23.20, §23.30).
   *
   * The fault is real and measured. On one Mac, `kill -9` on a job up well past
   * `minimum runtime = 10` left it down for a full 60 s watch with `runs` frozen, while the
   * same job on a second Mac came back unattended in 5 s (`runs` 15 → 16). `kickstart` works
   * on both, which is why it hides behind every manual fix and every install.
   *
   * ## What it is not (§23.30)
   *
   * This function used to warn that the cause was an install from a non-GUI session, and to
   * prescribe re-running `install` from the machine's own desktop. **Both were wrong.** The
   * affected machine was then installed from its own desktop, as the console user, in an
   * `Aqua` session — and the service stayed pended. launchd's own log gives the real reason:
   *
   * ```
   * pending spawn, domain in on-demand-only mode: com.github.drmuzikbpn.claude-usage
   * ```
   *
   * That is a property of the `gui/<uid>` **domain**, not of the installing session. Ruled
   * out with evidence: the launchd disabled database (`print-disabled` lists it on neither
   * machine), session type (`Aqua` on both), console ownership (`/dev/console` owned by the
   * logged-in user on both), screen lock, plist contents (identical), and install-before-login
   * ordering (true on both).
   *
   * Three candidate install-time detectors were tested and all three are unusable:
   * `launchctl managername` (the old one — false positive for an ssh install on a healthy
   * domain, false negative for the case that actually bit), `immediate reason` (reports only
   * how the current instance was started; a `kickstart` flips a healthy Mac to `non-ipc
   * demand` and it still self-heals) and the domain's `on-demand count` (unchanged across
   * bootout, bootstrap and kickstart of this job).
   *
   * So the only honest signal left is the symptom itself, and it is only printed while the
   * job is **not running** — which an install never is, having just kickstarted it. This
   * therefore stays quiet during a healthy-looking install rather than guessing. A check that
   * cannot fire is worse than one that can; a check that fires with the wrong remedy is worse
   * than both, and that is what shipped.
   *
   * Returns human-readable warnings, empty when nothing is wrong. Never throws: a
   * diagnostic that fails must not fail an install.
